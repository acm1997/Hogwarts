2019/2020 Program Development Subject Assignment.
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: We have the main class called Hogwarts where in each turn we simulate the dueling field between the different characters of Hogwarts.
duels between the different characters of the different houses that make up Hogwarts. 
AUTHORS: Ángel Cañada Muñoz y Juan Manuel Mancera Ortiz
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To execute the project, we have created a main, which at the beginning asks the user to select the file to load: With the numeric key 1, it will load
the data of the file InitData1, and with the key 2, it will load the data of the file InitData2. Subsequently, our project will proceed to simulate a different dueling situation in our Hogwarts castle. 
This simulation will be performed on the data loaded from one of the files we have chosen. Finally, our program
will return an output file "output.txt" with the final results and the winning house of the game.
